        "Adding attributes directly to the CompositeSpec using `add_attr` also failed. It seems the standard way to modify the spec of a transformed environment or its components might require using the `Transform` objects provided by torchrl, or there might be a misunderstanding of how to modify specs in this torchrl version. Given the persistent issues with adding keys to the state spec, a simpler workaround for this specific subtask (collecting data) is to manually add the required RNN state keys with zero tensors to the initial tensordict returned by `env.reset()` *before* passing it to the collector's `set_seed` or `reset` if that's possible, or to the tensordict before passing it to the policy in the collection loop if the collector allows hooks. However, the `SyncDataCollector` is designed to handle the initial state if the spec is correctly defined. The most likely issue is still with correctly modifying the `state_spec` of the `TransformedEnv`. Let's try one more approach to modify the spec: creating a new `CompositeSpec` with the desired keys and assigning it back to `transformed_env.state_spec['agents']`. If this still fails, it indicates a fundamental issue with modifying specs in this torchrl setup, and we may need to adjust the approach significantly or accept failure for this subtask as the collector cannot be initialized correctly without the required state keys in the spec.\n",

        "The error message \"The shapes of the spec Tensor and the Composite mismatch: the first 1 dimensions should match but got spec.shape=torch.Size([5, 64]) and Composite.shape=torch.Size([2]).\" indicates that the shape of the tensors used to define the specs for the RNN hidden states (which are defined as `torch.zeros(num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim)`) does not match the batch shape of the `CompositeSpec` for 'agents' in the environment's state spec (which is `torch.Size([num_envs])`). The spec for a nested tensordict key should have a shape that aligns with the event shape of that key within the tensordict structure, and the batch shape is handled by the parent tensordict or spec. In this case, the RNN hidden state spec should have a shape corresponding to `[num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]`, and the batch dimension (`num_envs`) is handled by the outer `state_spec` or the tensordict itself. The error occurs because we are trying to create a new `CompositeSpec` for `state_spec['agents']` with a shape of `[num_envs]` but providing specs for the RNN states with a shape of `[num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]`. The spec for `('agents', 'rnn_hidden_state')` should be something like `UnboundedContinuous(shape=torch.Size([num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]), ...)`. Let's correct the way we create the specs for the new keys within the `new_agent_spec_dict` to use `UnboundedContinuous` with the correct shape `[num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]`.\n",

        "The error persists, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of how shapes work within nested `CompositeSpec` or how to correctly add specs for keys that represent batched data within a batched environment in this torchrl version. The spec for a key like `('agents', 'rnn_hidden_state')` within a `CompositeSpec` that itself has a batch shape (corresponding to `num_envs`) should likely represent the shape of the *individual* item for that key, i.e., `[num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]`. The outer `CompositeSpec`'s shape handles the batch dimension. However, the error message suggests a mismatch between `[5, 64]` (our intended item shape) and `[2]` (the batch shape of the 'agents' CompositeSpec). This is confusing. Given the difficulty in correctly modifying the spec, let's try a different approach for this specific subtask: directly using the `env.reset()` output and manually adding the RNN state keys to it *before* calling `collector.next()`. This bypasses the need to modify the environment's state spec for the collector's initialization, allowing us to at least attempt data collection. This is not the ideal long-term solution for training with a collector that manages state, but it might help isolate the issue and complete the immediate subtask of collecting a single batch.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Problem Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning task within a simulated Fuel Price Environment. The environment involves multiple agents interacting within a graph structure, where nodes represent locations and edges represent connections. Each agent is situated at a node and needs to make decisions (actions) to optimize its objective, which is related to managing fuel prices. The environment's state is characterized by the features of the nodes (`x`) and the graph connectivity (`edge_index`). The agents receive a reward based on their actions and the resulting changes in the environment. The task is sequential, as agents make decisions over time, and the environment transitions based on their collective actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agent Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Each agent in the multi-agent system utilizes a shared network architecture based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The architecture is designed to process the graph-structured observations and sequential dependencies inherent in the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The observation, consisting of node features (`x`) and edge indices (`edge_index`), is first processed by a GCN layer (`GCNConv`). This layer aggregates information from neighboring nodes, allowing the network to capture spatial dependencies within the graph. The output of the GCN has a shape reflecting the number of environments, agents, and the GCN hidden dimension (`[num_envs, num_agents, gcn_hidden_dim]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "The output from the GCN is then fed into a GRU layer. The GRU is used to process the sequential nature of the observations over time and maintain an internal hidden state (`rnn_hidden_state`). The GRU operates on the flattened batch of agents across all environments (`[1, num_envs * num_agents, gcn_hidden_dim]`), and its output is then reshaped back to reflect the environment and agent structure (`[num_envs, num_agents, hidden_rnn_dim]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of the GRU, representing a learned representation for each agent, is then flattened across the agent dimension (`[num_envs, num_agents * hidden_rnn_dim]`) and passed through a linear layer. This linear layer produces the raw outputs for both the policy (action logits) and the forecasting module.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n",
        "\n",
        "The agents are trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. PPO is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to improve the stability of policy updates compared to standard policy gradient methods. It achieves this by using a clipping mechanism that limits the policy change at each optimization step.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PPO algorithm involves training two main components: a policy network and a value network.\n",
        "*   The **policy network** (part of the combined policy/forecasting module) outputs action probabilities (derived from logits) for each agent. The policy is represented by a `ProbabilisticActor` that samples actions from a `MultiCategorical` distribution based on the output logits and provides the log probability of the sampled actions.\n",
        "*   The **value network** estimates the expected cumulative future reward (value) for a given state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PPO objective function is designed to maximize a clipped surrogate objective, which encourages policy updates that improve performance while staying close to the previous policy. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is used to provide a balanced trade-off between bias and variance when estimating the advantage of actions. The total PPO loss includes a policy loss (clipped surrogate objective), a value loss (Mean Squared Error between estimated values and returns), and an entropy bonus (to encourage exploration).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Forecasting Integration and Loss\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the standard PPO objective, the model incorporates a forecasting component that predicts future node features (`x`) for a specified forecast horizon (`forecast_horizon`). This forecasting is performed by the forecasting module, which shares the initial GCN and GRU layers with the policy network but has a separate linear output layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The forecasting module outputs a tensor representing the predicted node features for each agent over the forecast horizon. The forecasting loss is computed using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted future `x` values and the actual `x` values observed in the subsequent steps of the collected trajectory.
